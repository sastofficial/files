    05:19AM EST - Notation 1:
    ``Crabby is a common user of guilt tripping.``
    He will use very practical means with just about anyone, to the normal person, they just probably would shrug it off, however I feel this is used mostly with his "friends" in mind. They're more likely to feel bad for him.
    A lot of examples can be seen throughout the server

    05:21AM EST - Notation 2:
    ``Crabby commonly will backtrack if cornered in an argument, or if he wants to prolong it``
    He will often times repeat things or loop back around on things he says. Causing a sort of loop / repetition in having to explain the same things to him. And he just gives the same answers. He most likely does this until the other person succumbs to telling him what he wants to hear

    05:23AM EST - Notation 3:
    ``Crabby wants to "live on the edge"``
    Party like there ain't no tomorrow? Well he shouldn't have taken that psychology tip. I know from experience that simply being nice is enough to warrant him developing a love interest in you. Even if both sides are already taken. He was more than willing to cheat on his boyfriend for the sake of being with me, which I never agreed to.
    Yet he complains and defends that his boyfriend is the best thing to ever happen to him.

    05:26AM EST - Notation 4:
    ``Crabby always has to get the last word in``
    He created multiple alts to harass me and try to keep a convo going. He also joined Eli's server by stalking up an invite link she posted on a social. He does this because he wants a reason to argue, most likely. He wants to get the last word in always.
    I know this because when I originally unadded him, he immediately tried to add me back. I blocked him later.
    What do you know? He makes an alt with a weird name. I think it's just some random. Nope, it's him.
    I blocked that one too. What do you know?
